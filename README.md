# Kamikaze

This is my favorite coding challenge of all I have done so far, the experience of days of debugging and finding solutions to various vehicle collision cases, track parsing, and simulating was super fun and memorable experience. Hopefully someday I will sit down again and refactor this beauty of challenge's code. (:
